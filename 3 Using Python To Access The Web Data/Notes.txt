Regular Expression :
Used for finding string, specific patterns ,etc.
-->	import re
	hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
	for line in hand:
		line = line.rstrip()
		if re.search('From :',line):
			print(line)
	* re.search('^From :') --> ()to indicate first word of line
	* ^X.*:		--> if we translate this little regular expression with English, is I'm looking for lines that have an X at the beginning, capital X, followed by any number of characters, followed by a colon. So a colon's not a special character, X is not a special character, but caret is a special character, dot and star are. 
	* ^__  -  Strts with__
	* .    -  any character that matches
	* +    -  one or more charcters
	* :    -  last character in the match
	* *    -  any number of characters

IMP : re.findall('\S+@\S+',x)   ==> returns a list.

Greedy Matching :
	^F.+?:
	* ?  - dont be greedy
